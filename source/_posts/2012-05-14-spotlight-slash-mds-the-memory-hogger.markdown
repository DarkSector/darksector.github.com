So in a yet another failure of an experience with the Mac Mini I have now realized why Apple is trying to put in SSD in all its products. I think it's because of the memory hogger called mds. It is supposed sit quietly and index files but as it turns out, the bugger takes almost 50 percent of the RAM.

The highlighted one is the one I am talking about. I think I need to disable spotlight and put in QuickSilver. 

I shall call my app, GetLostSpotlight. The code will be on Github obviously.
