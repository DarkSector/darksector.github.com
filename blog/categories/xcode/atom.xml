    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Once the novelty of getting a new mac has worn off, the real trouble sets in. Configuring it. Now the shittiest part about developing on a Mac is the downloading of Xcode and installing it. Xcode is by far the shittiest and the most disgusting piece of software designed by Apple. Now in order to get the latest Xcode you'll need to upgrade to the latest OS. Currently it's 10.7.3.</p>

<p>So to get Xcode 4.3 you need to first upgrade to 10.7.3 and then go through the motions of getting Xcode first and then letting it install itself.</p>

<p>Since most of the packages come with a proper building process, it's necessary to have GCC 4.2-llvm or clang installed and that comes only with Xcode. So till the time you get it, you can't use Machomebrew or most of the Python packages.</p>

<p>I guess I'll have to take this POS home and then put it on a continuous install. Thanks a lot Apple. So much for your design.</p>
