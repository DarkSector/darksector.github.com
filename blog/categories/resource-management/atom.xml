    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So we finally deployed on <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> for a quick run and what do we find? The dynos idle if not used for an hour. So your app will sleep if you don't send it a request for an hour. I was scared for a second when I realized my app had been killed because probably it refused to sleep.</p>

<p>But hey what's this, there's another app that sends request to wake idling apps so that the dynos won't sleep. Enter <a href="http://www.wekkars.com/">Wekkars</a>. I mean there isn't a puzzle created by human beings that another human being can't solve. Well I read that in an Edgar Allan Poe book so nevermind the cheesy lines.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the good thing about Heroku is it's ease of deployment. I mean what do you need to do really:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create your app</li>
<li>Create a Procfile that will start your app</li>
<li>Commit code to heroku master (using git)</li>
<li>Profit</li>
</ol>


<p>there's an additional 3.5 that involves adding a helper add on but that is trivial. So Heroku is pretty good, we'll continue testing.</p>
