I am moving away from [Ghost](https://ghost.org/). It's just hard to maintain on your own and I am not paying for a pro account. I mean I can see its merits if I were a pro blogger but I write to keep track of stuff mostly. So Github will do. I am pretty sure I am behind on 2 major updates and at this point it's just too much work to integrate all those minor and major updates.

So back to Github pages. It's the same markdown after all.
