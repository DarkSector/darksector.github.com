[BYOG](https://itch.io/jam/byog) is back in town and we're getting a lot of time to get ready. I've tried and tried to build a game and then build on top of that but for some reason my engergy fizzles out. Usually it's because things aren't moving as fast as I'd like them or I am fighting the framework/game engine. I mean half the time you're trying to figure out how to do something in Unity and then you lose out on the momentum to actually build the next thing on the list.

So, surprise surprise, I've decided to try again. This time using Godot and build close to 5 games in the next 10 days. I want to participate in the Game Jam and build something to completion. An hour or two a day, maybe and then something quick in 48h for the jam.

Starting with Godot's own [Dodge The Creeps](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html) and then maybe to my favorite, PONG. I gotta find me a list that are easy to build for beginners.

Just thought I should write this down.
