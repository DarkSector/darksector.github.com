I've decided to learn Typescript since I am on a roll - learning strongly typed languages. I am currently working on Rust and Python and it's only fair to start using Typescript to build all my Electron/React/Native projects.

I've started a [repo here](https://github.com/DarkSector/typescript-playground) and I am building projects to learn.
